# Liquid Democracy Experiment

This repository contains code for a minor research project based on the paper **"When is Liquid Democracy Possible?"**

The goal is to test whether delegated voting in complete graphs can outperform direct voting.

We implemented the algorithm and ran experiments using complete graphs. The results support the claims made in the original theory.
