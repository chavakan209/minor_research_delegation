# Liquid Democracy Experiment

This repository contains code for a minor research project based on the paper **"When is Liquid Democracy Possible?"**


**Introduction:** In this minor research project, we experimentally evaluated the theoretical results proposed in _**When is liquid democracy possible?**_. The paper states that doing vote delegations in complete graphs, when certain criteria are met, will always result in better voting result than doing direct voting. Our goal is to implement the algorithms and experimentally evaluate the theoretical results of the paper. We perform experiments with complete graphs and find that the experimental results are in line with the theoretical claims.
